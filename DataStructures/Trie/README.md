# Trie Data Structure (Prefix Tree):
The trie data structure, also known as a prefix tree, is a tree-like data structure used for efficient retrieval of key-value pairs. It is commonly used for implementing dictionaries and autocomplete features, making it a fundamental component in many search algorithms. In this article, we will explore all about Trie data structures in detail.
